    <p class="fade-in-text"> Engraver's Old English origins are from Blackletter scripts from medieval Western Europe around the 12th century. The timeline of blackletter typeface starts with the Carolingian script which was a compressed script that was used for various texts during the time. But As demand for written materials grew during the 12th century, Carolingian script was replaced by textualis quadrata (textura blackletter script) since its simplified letterforms increased writing speed. Its angular, compact form could be produced faster with the broad-nib pens of the era. Textualis quadrata also evolved into a type for Johannes Gutenberg's printing press in the 15th century. When Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press in the 15th century, he needed a typeface that mimicked the popular handwriting style of the day to make his printed books look familiar and authoritative. He chose a Textura-style blackletter for his famous Gutenberg Bible. The 19th century U.S. saw a widespread resurgence of interest in medieval styles, known as the Gothic Revival. In the U.S., steel engraving based on the Textura script ascended to become the prominent technique for the production of formal documents. This would had inspired Engravers Old English.</p>
