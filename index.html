      <h1 class="fade-in-text">Typeface Information</h1>
      <p class="fade-in-text">Engravers Old English is a blackletter typeface created by Morris Fuller Benton for the American Type Founders (ATF) company in 1901. It is a sturdy and modernized version of the Old English style typeface, designed to mimic the engraved lettering on American social and business documents from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  </p>
      <p class="fade-in-text">It was widely used for diplomas, certificates, legal deeds, newspaper mashheads, advertising, and letterheads due to its decorative and distinguished appearance.</p>
      <p class="fade-in-text">While the typeface is primarily attributed to Benton. The original metal type was released by American Type Founders (ATF), which was a dominant U.S. manufacturer of metal type. A variation, Engravers Old English Open, was released by ATF in 1902, and a bold version was designed in 1910.</p>
